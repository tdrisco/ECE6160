Final Project:

Developed a KNN (k-nearest neighbor) supervised machine learning algorithm for
identifying downed power lines in a simulated grid. Leveraged a real-time grid 
simulator and MATLAB's app designer to utilize trained machine learning model for 
real-time grid situational awareness. Compared model to other algorithms and 
identified the most accurate, and effecient detection method. This project was
hosted in Clemson's Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systmes Laboratory.

Final Project:

Developed a KNN (k-nearest neighbor) supervised machine learning algorithm for identifying downed power lines in a simulated grid. Leveraged a real-time grid simulator and MATLAB's app designer to utilize the trained machine learning model for real-time grid situational awareness. Compared the model to other algorithms and identified the most accurate and efficient detection method. This project was hosted in Clemson's Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory.
